ELMSLN Developer - Instances
================

Use this directory to manage your individual deployments of ELMSLN. It is
recommended that ELMSLN be managed as (at least) 2 separate repositories. One
for everything in your elmsln deployment that IS NOT in the config directory,
then another repo just for your config directory.

While this package is setup to have elmsln managed in the "github" directory,
it is also recommended that you setup an alternate remote to map to. This is
how PSU manages the packages in their deployments in-house.

The recommendation is to take the example repo (elmsln-config-example) and fork it so that itâ€™s your own repo.
